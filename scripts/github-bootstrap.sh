# One-time setup for the GitHub Issues + Projects workflow described in
# docs/WORKFLOW.md: creates the labels and the Project (v2) board with its
# Status/Priority/Phase fields, and links the board to this repo.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   1. gh auth login   (or: gh auth refresh -s project,read:project   if already logged in)
#   2. Run this from inside the repo (it uses `gh repo view` to detect owner/repo).
#
# Safe to re-run:
#   - labels: created with --force (update in place)
#   - project: skipped if a project with the same title already exists
#   - fields: Priority/Phase skipped if they already exist; the built-in
#     "Status" field (Todo/In Progress/Done, present on every new project)
#     is replaced with our Backlog/Ready/In Progress/In Review/Done set
#     only the first time — once it's been customized, later runs leave
#     it alone so in-progress work isn't reset.
